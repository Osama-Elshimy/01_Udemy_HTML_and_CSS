# Classes and IDs Selectors.

We can use Classes and IDs to select the exact elements that we want to style. This is by far the most efficient way to do this.  

We define th _ID_ name inside of the _HTML_ element.  
The _ID_ name is unique within the _HTML_ file. We can't use the _ID_ name in more than one _HTML_ element.  
We select the _ID_ inside the _CSS_ file using _#_ then the name of the _ID_  
 
_CODE_:

\#author {  
 font-style: italic;  
}

### In the real world, we never use _IDs_. This way we are ready for any changes in the future.

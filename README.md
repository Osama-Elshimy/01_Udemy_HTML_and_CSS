# Introduction to Flexbox

---

When _flexbox_ is used:

**CODE**:  
 `display: flex;`

- The elements only occupy the width necessary for the text, and occupy the height of the element the has the biggest height value.
- If no height is specified, the elements will also occupy only the height necessary for the text.

_Flexbox_ introduces very useful features:

- We can center the elements vertically with just one line of code  
  **CODE**:  
  `align-items: center;`

- We can center the elements horizontally with just one line of code  
  **CODE**:  
  `justify-content: center;`

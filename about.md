# HTML Document Structure

### Every HTML file must have a _DOCTYPE_ tag, a _HTML_ tag, a _head_ tag and a _body_ tag.

#### The _head_ tag is where the information about the page is displayed. These information are not visible to the browser.

#### The body tag is where the content of the page is displayed.

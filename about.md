# Using Margings and Paddings.

#### A _padding_ is the space between an element's border and the element's content. The _padding_ is inside the element's border.

- _padding_ is useful when an element has a background color.

#### A _margin_ is the space around an element's border. It controls the space outside the element. The _margin_ is outside the element's border.

- It's best practice to just use _margin-top_ or to just use _margin-bottom_ and **NOT** to use them together. This is best to avoid margin collisions.

# Inline, Internal and External CSS

## How to write CSS?

### There are 3 ways to write CSS:

1. _Inline_: In which we write _CSS_ inside the _HTML_ element.

   - _Note_: Inline _CSS_ should never be used.

2. _Internal_: In which we write _CSS_ inside a _style_ element inside the _head_ of the _HTML_ file.

3. _External_: In which we write _CSS_ in a separate file.

   - _Note_: This is the most favoured method in writing CSS

   - We need to link the _HTML_ file with the _CSS_ external file through a _link_ tag inside the _head_ tag in the HTML file.

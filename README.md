## CSS Theory#5: Absolute Positioning.

## Normal Flow:

- Default position
- Element is **"in flow"**
- Elements are simply laid out according to their order in the HTML code

**CODE**:  
position: relative;

## Absolute Positioning:

- Element is removed from the normal flow: **"out of flow"**
- No impact on surrounding elements, might overlap them
- We use top, bottom, left or right to offset the element from its **relatively positioned container**

**CODE**:  
position: absolute;

# Styling Text

The _h1_ element doesn't have to be the biggest element. It's all about symmetry.

When you select an element in the _CSS_ file, you will apply the style to all the elements of that selected type.  
For example if you set the color of the _h2_ element to red, then all the _h2_ in the web page will be red.

When you select an element in the _CSS_ file, you will apply the style to all the child elements of the element you selcted. This is called Inheritance.

# Building a Simple Float Layout.

#### In this bransh, I built a very simple layout using _floats_, by simply setting the _article_ element _float_ property to left, and setting the _aside_ element _float_ property to right, and setting the _footer_ element _clear_ property to both.

#### It's important to note that floats are not the best way to build layouts, but it's important to have an idea about how they work.

#### In the following branch, I'll use better methods.
